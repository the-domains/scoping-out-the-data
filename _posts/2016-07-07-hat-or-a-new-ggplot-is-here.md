      A message from Josh Tyrangiel -Josh Tyrangiel You are an educated,
      successful person capable of abstract thought. A VP doing an SVP's job.
      Your office, appointed with decent furniture and a healthy amount of
      natural light filtered through vertical blinds, is commensurate with
      nearly two decades of service to the craft of management.

  A brief note from the author... After launching ggplot in September of 2014 to
  great fanfare, there was a bit of a "development hiatus". It took a while, but
  I finally freed up enough of my weekends to give ggplot some TLC (oh wait not
  that TLC, this TLC).
